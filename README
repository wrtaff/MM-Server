Journal for the file, from pluto, 3:18
back from titan, 3:55
titan: stopped using bin in repository.  Each can create their own bin.
pluto: test to see if using my new name. 
pluto: It doesn't really use the name, just wrtaff.  At this point,
way ahead is to add comments, and to make functions that 
execute by a call e.g. ALICE:RUN_HELLO or ALICE:HALT_EXECUTION or
ALICE:CHECK_INBOX
